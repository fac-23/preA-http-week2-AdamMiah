A project that utilises API's 

## Core Stories 
As a user, I want to:

- See an interesting mashup of different data
- Input information to change the displayed result
- View the app on all of my devices
- Since your app will be unique you will need to create your own user stories for more specific features.

## Stretch stories 
- As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading
- As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong
## Acceptance Criteria 
- Query at least two APIs using fetch
- Dynamic content generated with JS
- A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
